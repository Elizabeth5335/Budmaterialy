# Budmaterialy

Building Materials was my first attempt to create a web page.
                                        
It is a one-page website with adaptive layout. It was written without any frameworks - using bare HTML and CSS. Some JavaScript fragments were used to create responsive navigation and a "scroll to top" button.

It was hosted on GitHub Pages: https://elizabeth5335.github.io/Budmaterialy/
